  Ma lady
  i am really sorry again for whatever i did
  that photo was a weird one because i was fixing my mask and my hand was placed like i am tickling my nose
  i was embarrased to show that to you.
  im really sorry for running like that
as being a responsible boyfriend i will not repeat such thing again
